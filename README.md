These are my Lab Assignment files with solution of Brac University's Computer Science & Engineering departmental core course CSE423 known as Computer Graphics. These Lab assignments are given during Spring'2023 Semester for the course work.

I made this project using Pygame. Some computer graphics algorithms, like the DDA algorithm, midpoint line, and midpoint circle drawing algorithm, are used here. At first, the orbit is divided into 8 zones, where in the center the earth is located. The moon will rotate to the appropriate zone based on the input of date and month.
